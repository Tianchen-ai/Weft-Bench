# Triton–Weft integration

Bench calls the installed Triton–Weft compiler through its public interfaces:
`@triton.jit(model="weft")`, `triton.compile`, `CompiledKernel.export`, `triton.load`
and `triton.Package.create`. The compiler owns lowering, autotuning, caching and
native code generation. Bench owns workload inputs, numerical oracles, measurement
and results. [Installation](install.md) and [target configuration](targets.md)
describe the environment setup.

## Source and native artifacts

Set the implementation factory to
`weft_bench.adapters.triton_native:TritonAdapter`. An implementation name such as
`weft` or `candidate` is only a label; the factory selects the compiler path.

| Input | Configuration |
|---|---|
| Source | Host `python`, optional `pythonpath`, `source`, `symbol`, `signature`, `constexprs`, `backend_options`, `toolchain` |
| Exported AOT | `artifact` directory with native library, manifest, header and runtime dependencies |
| Single instance | `entry: "single"` (default) |
| Native grid | `entry: "grid"`, `grid`, `num_cpu_threads` |

The target declares its ISA/VLEN and execution-side `triton_runtime.include` and
`triton_runtime.library`. Cross compilation uses the configured host toolchain and
target sysroot. Bench loads the exported candidate library directly; its C++ compiler
builds the measurement worker, not a second version of the candidate C.

The typed artifact ABI supplies argument order, encoding, access, dimensions and
strides. View arguments must match the declared logical shape. Pointer arguments
use the workload's actual storage and explicit size/stride arguments; an empty
pointer shape does not mean one element. No adapter parses C parameter names.

Native grid execution invokes the product launcher once for the whole workload.
It requires whole-workload buffers and cannot wrap an existing row/tile-loop
workload in another grid. Runtime capability checks remain active. The configured
CPU affinity must cover the intended worker set.

## Timing scopes

| Scope | Included |
|---|---|
| Native single instance | Complete candidate C ABI call |
| Native grid | Complete native grid launch, worker scheduling and synchronization |
| Python JIT grid | Warm `kernel[grid]` call, including Python binding and runtime guards |
| Model phase | The selected llama.cpp prefill or decode measurement window |

Compilation, allocation, input generation, numerical checking, state restoration
and first runtime initialization are outside normal timing. Work required by the
algorithm, such as projection quantization, stays inside the call. Existing multi-row
dot and packed IME cases retain their original boundaries. A grid time cannot be
divided by its instance count and presented as a leaf-call measurement.

An adapter change does not invalidate an otherwise identical fixed baseline.
Shape, inputs, cache mode, call scope and execution settings determine whether a
comparison is meaningful. Mismatches remain visible in results and `explain`.

## Target-side Python JIT

`weft_bench.adapters.triton_jit:TritonJitAdapter` uses a configured target-side
`python`, `environment` and `toolchain`, with source/symbol, constexprs, grid and
thread options. The existing native fixture supplies input storage and the oracle.
Results separate cold compile+launch, first cache-hit launch and warm Python timing.
The Python-call scope is not compared with native-only GGML as operator speedup.

Optional `check_python_aot` checks exported/reloaded execution.
`check_torch_compile` checks first and cached `torch.compile(fullgraph=True)` calls
in a compatible configured framework environment. These checks are outside warm
timing and default to off. This adapter's shared Tensor fixture currently supports
float32, one output, whole-workload calls and reused inputs. Other numerical and
framework contracts use explicitly selected [verification cases](verification.md).

Optional `profile_runtime` retains normal uninstrumented samples and records
available Python runtime segments separately. If the installed runtime uses a C++
launcher that cannot expose those segments, they are `unavailable`; unobserved
internal work is not reported as zero.

## llama.cpp packages

Set `llama.package_backend` to `triton` and select the host package preparation
environment in `llama.triton`. `--replace ROLE=ARTIFACT` calls the public package
API and deploys the native package. Source replacements additionally need the
role's signature, constexprs, backend options and toolchain. This route does not
recompile or relink the exported candidate on the execution machine.

Use compatible normal and integrated llama.cpp builds with matching ordinary
backend settings. Replacement roles and measurement phases are independent:
`--phase prefill|decode|both` selects the windows; the package selects the hooks.
Consult `list --kind replacements` for the current role catalog, including distinct
prefill/decode IME entries. Only measured-window call-count increments establish a
hit. `not_hit` means an observed zero count; `not_observed` means no usable observation.

`e2e --validate --validation-reference PATH` checks full-vocabulary logits for the
configured prompt and teacher-forced decode sample outside phase timing. Its saved
normal-model numerical reference is separate from the timing baseline. Select
`llama.validation` prompt length, decode steps and tolerances before execution;
this sample does not establish correctness for every model input.

## Diagnosis and reusable workloads

Native replay defaults to a saved artifact. Source-origin runs can use `--source`
with the recorded Triton environment/options; the legacy `--compiler` flag does
not select a Triton compiler. Historical flat snapshots with relative imports
require the matching package checkout. Preserve available IR, C, compiler diagnostics
and the actual executed artifact; compilation alone is not numerical evidence.

Optional `shared-semantics` and `pointer-semantics` workloads share the existing
worker. They cover ordinary array operations, masked/strided pointers, reductions,
helper control flow and typed operations. Alias cases restore state before each
call; Linux protected-page cases detect forbidden masked accesses. Scan and atomic
cases also use this worker, with explicit mutable state and returned-old-value
checks. These workloads do not enter `quick` or invent GGML performance references.

`causal_attention` is an optional complete attention workload with grouped-query
heads, a causal prefix and an independent numerical oracle. Its full candidate call
is timed, including required internal state updates. It currently has no bound GGML
performance implementation.

The [Codex plugin](codex-plugin.md) exposes these same paths. Its environment names,
compiler installations, machine addresses and model paths remain external settings.
